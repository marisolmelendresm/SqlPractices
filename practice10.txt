Challenge: Instead of using the office as a pivot use the flavor and the office as columns

SELECT * from crosstab('SELECT flavor, office, count(*) FROM ice_cream_survey GROUP BY flavor, office ORDER BY flavor,
  SELECT office FROM ice_cream_survey GROUP BY office ORDER BY office)
AS (flavor text, Downtown bgint, Midtown bgint, Uptown bgint)
