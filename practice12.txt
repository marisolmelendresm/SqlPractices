VIEWS AND MATERIALIZED VIEWS

-> Views are used to visualize the result from a query.
  -> They update whenever the tables that created it get updated
  
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW county_pop_change_2019_2010 AS
    SELECT c2019.county_name,
           c2019.state_name,
           c2019.state_fips,
           c2019.county_fips,
           c2019.pop_est_2019 AS pop_2019,
           c2010.estimates_base_2010 AS pop_2010,
           round( (c2019.pop_est_2019::numeric - c2010.estimates_base_2010)
               / c2010.estimates_base_2010 * 100, 1 ) AS pct_change_2019_2010
    FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 AS c2019
        JOIN us_counties_pop_est_2010 AS c2010
    ON c2019.state_fips = c2010.state_fips
        AND c2019.county_fips = c2010.county_fips;
  
-> Materialized view is used to increase performance when the query is too complex
  -> Data is storaged
  
 CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW nevada_counties_pop_2019 AS
    SELECT county_name,
           state_fips,
           county_fips,
           pop_est_2019
    FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019
    WHERE state_name = 'Nevada';
